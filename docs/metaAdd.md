💡 Quick Solutions:
Option 1: Import WhatsApp Contacts (I Can Build This NOW)
I can create a tool where you:

Export contacts from WhatsApp Business app
Upload CSV to your CRM
All WhatsApp contacts automatically become leads
Time: 30 minutes to build, you can use today

Option 2: Add Lead Form Before WhatsApp (Best Long-term)
Update your Instagram ads:

User clicks ad → Fills quick form (name, phone) → Form saves to CRM → WhatsApp opens
You get their info before they even message
They still chat with you on WhatsApp
Future contacts automatically captured
Time: 1-2 hours to set up

Option 3: WhatsApp Business API (For High Volume)
If you're getting 50+ messages daily, this auto-syncs all conversations to CRM.

Time: 2-4 weeks, $25-100/month

🚀 What I Can Do Right Now
Would you like me to create a "WhatsApp Import" page where you can:

Upload a CSV file with WhatsApp contacts (name, phone, notes)
Automatically add them as leads in your CRM
Assign to team members
Track follow-up status
This gets your existing WhatsApp contacts into CRM today, while you work on the long-term solution (lead forms).
